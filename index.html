    HTTP crash course

    HTTP is stateless (independent)

    HTTPS is "Secure" -- encrytped by SSL 'Secure Socket Layer' / or TLS 'Transport Security Layer'
                
    HTTP Methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (most common)

            Status Codes : 1xx Informational,
                           2xx Success,
                           3xx Redirect, 
                           4xx Client Error, 
                           5xx Server Error, 

HTTP/2 changes are faster, more efficient, and under the hood (no changes on user end is required)
        features "FULL REQUEST AND RESPONSE MULTIPLEXING" 
             (allows html, css, js to all be sent at once instead of 1 at a time)


      opened inspect in Chrome (right click on website and choose 'inspect on the bottom' <shortcut Shift-CTRL-I>) 
          looked around in the 'Network' tab and saw how check the general methods that were used and responses    
          
          
POSTMAN -- used postman -- super fast crash course.. didn't do anything but look yet. now onto... 

   setup an express server with npm == see steps below

EXPRESS: for local api server:
            Node.js (Node) is an open-source server-side platform built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Due to its 
                ability to run on various platforms and its scalability, Node has become a “go-to” option for
                 developing web applications.

EXPRESS a small framework that sits on top of Node.js's web server.
            -- simplify APIs and add new features
            -- makes it easier to organize apps functionality with 'middle ware' and 'routing'
            -- add helpful utilitis to Node.js's HTTP objects. it facilitates rendering of dynamic HTTP objects

       *Express is part of MEAN stack a full stack JavaScript solution used to build fast, 
                    robust maintable production web apps. 

   *In more simplistic terms, Node allows you to run JavaScript outside of your browser
                   and Express enables you to respond to individual client requests and build APIs quickly.                  
  
HOW TO INSTALL: 
        in terminal: 1) mkdir <directory name>
                        cd <directory>
                     
                     2) Use npm to treate a package.json for the project
                            $ npm init
                        
                            continue to hit enter (or fill out the information if needed) until 'terminus' line.
                     3) Install Express:
                            while in the correct working directory
                                    $ npm install express --save  
                                          *check express was installed with $ npm --version express

    I set up a local host on 5000 we went into Postman and was able
                 to set up responses for incoming HTTP Methods
